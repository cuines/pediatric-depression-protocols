# Adolescent Depression Screening Protocol
**Version:** 2.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-30  
**Responsible Clinic:** Pediatric Mental Health Team

## Purpose
This protocol outlines the standardized approach for screening adolescents (ages 12‑18) for depression in our pediatric practice. Early detection and intervention are critical to improving outcomes.

## Screening Tool
- **PHQ‑9A** (Patient Health Questionnaire‑9 Modified for Adolescents) is the primary screening instrument.
- **Alternative tools:** For older adolescents (≥16 years), the standard PHQ‑9 may be used if preferred. For systematic suicide risk assessment, consider the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C‑SSRS) as an adjunct.
- **Screening frequency:** Annually at well‑child visits, or as clinically indicated (e.g., parent/patient concern, behavioral changes).

## Administration
1. Provide the PHQ‑9A form to the adolescent in a private setting.
2. Explain that the questions are about how they have been feeling over the **past two weeks**.
3. Allow the adolescent to complete the form independently; offer assistance if needed.

## Scoring and Interpretation
- Each item is scored 0 (“Not at all”) to 3 (“Nearly every day”).
- **Total score ranges:**
  - 0‑4: Minimal depression
  - 5‑9: Mild depression
  - 10‑14: Moderate depression
  - 15‑19: Moderately severe depression
  - 20‑27: Severe depression

## Positive Screen Workflow
A total score **≥10** (moderate or higher) is considered a positive screen and triggers the following steps:

### Immediate Provider Actions
1. **Review results with adolescent:** Discuss the score in a supportive, non‑judgmental manner. Validate their feelings and acknowledge the courage it took to complete the screen.
2. **Conduct safety assessment:** Ask directly about suicidal ideation, intent, plan, and access to means. Use the C‑SSRS questions if available. If acute risk is identified, follow the clinic’s Suicide Risk Protocol (see separate document) and do not leave the patient unattended.
3. **Engage parent/guardian (if appropriate):** With the adolescent’s consent, involve the parent/guardian in the discussion. Use the parent communication guide (below) to frame the conversation.
4. **Document findings:** Record the PHQ‑9A score, safety assessment, clinical impressions, and any immediate interventions in the patient’s chart.

### Further Evaluation and Referral
- **Mild‑moderate symptoms (score 10‑14):** Offer in‑house counseling or refer to a community mental health therapist. Provide a list of approved local therapists (see Referral Resources).
- **Moderately severe‑severe symptoms (score ≥15):** Refer to a child‑adolescent psychiatrist for medication evaluation and/or specialized therapy. Consider same‑day or next‑day consultation if acuity warrants.
- **Follow‑up appointment:** Schedule a follow‑up visit within **2 weeks** to monitor response and adherence to referrals. Re‑administer the PHQ‑9A at that visit to track symptom change.

## Parent Communication Guide
Discussing screening results with parents/guardians can be challenging. Below are suggested talking points:

### Opening the Conversation
- “Today we completed a routine depression screen as part of [adolescent’s] visit. The results suggest they are experiencing some symptoms of depression. I want to assure you that this is relatively common, and we have good resources to help.”

### Explaining the Results
- “The score ranges from 0 to 27, with higher numbers indicating more severe symptoms. [Adolescent’s] score of [X] falls in the [mild/moderate/severe] range, which means they could benefit from additional support.”

### Addressing Safety
- “We also talked about safety, and [adolescent] reported [no current thoughts of self‑harm / some thoughts but no plan or intent]. It’s important to create a safe environment at home and to let us know if any concerning behaviors emerge.”

### Next Steps
- “We recommend [specific referral or intervention]. I can provide you with a list of local therapists/psychiatrists who specialize in adolescent mental health. We’ll also schedule a follow‑up in two weeks to see how things are going.”

### Handouts and Resources
- Provide printed copies of the “Understanding Adolescent Depression” handout (available in clinic).
- Share links to reliable online resources (e.g., NAMI, AACAP).

### National Hotlines
- National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1‑800‑273‑TALK (8255)
- Crisis Text Line: Text “HOME” to 741741

## Follow‑up and Monitoring
- Re‑administer the PHQ‑9A at each follow‑up visit.
- Document symptom trajectory and any side effects of treatment.
- If symptoms worsen or do not improve after 6‑8 weeks, consider escalating care (e.g., referral to a higher level of specialty service).

## Review Cycle
This protocol will be reviewed annually by the Pediatric Mental Health Team. Updates will be documented in the version history below.
