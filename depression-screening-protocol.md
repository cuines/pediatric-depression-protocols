# Adolescent Depression Screening Protocol
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2024-01-15  
**Responsible Clinic:** Pediatric Mental Health Team

## Purpose
This protocol outlines the standardized approach for screening adolescents (ages 12‑18) for depression in our pediatric practice. Early detection and intervention are critical to improving outcomes.

## Screening Tool
- **PHQ‑9A** (Patient Health Questionnaire‑9 Modified for Adolescents) is the primary screening instrument.
- **Screening frequency:** Annually at well‑child visits, or as clinically indicated (e.g., parent/patient concern, behavioral changes).

## Administration
1. Provide the PHQ‑9A form to the adolescent in a private setting.
2. Explain that the questions are about how they have been feeling over the **past two weeks**.
3. Allow the adolescent to complete the form independently; offer assistance if needed.

## Scoring and Interpretation
- Each item is scored 0 (“Not at all”) to 3 (“Nearly every day”).
- **Total score ranges:**
  - 0‑4: Minimal depression
  - 5‑9: Mild depression
  - 10‑14: Moderate depression
  - 15‑19: Moderately severe depression
  - 20‑27: Severe depression

## Positive Screen Workflow
A total score **≥10** (moderate or higher) is considered a positive screen and triggers the following steps:

1. **Immediate clinician review:** The provider discusses the results with the adolescent (and parent/guardian if appropriate).
2. **Safety assessment:** Ask directly about suicidal ideation, intent, plan, and access to means. If acute risk is identified, follow the clinic’s Suicide Risk Protocol (see separate document).
3. **Further evaluation:** Consider a diagnostic interview, review of functional impairment, and comorbid conditions.
4. **Referral planning:**
   - **Mild‑moderate symptoms:** Refer to in‑house counseling or a community mental health therapist.
   - **Moderately severe‑severe symptoms:** Refer to a child‑adolescent psychiatrist for medication evaluation and/or specialized therapy.
5. **Documentation:** Record the PHQ‑9A score, clinical impressions, safety assessment, and referral plan in the patient’s chart.

## Follow‑up
- Schedule a follow‑up visit within 2‑4 weeks to monitor response and adherence to referrals.
- Re‑administer the PHQ‑9A at follow‑up to track symptom change.
